            About Me
            </h2>
          <p class="center">
            I have a bachelors in nursing and have been working in the field for over 2 years now.  Recently, I have sparked an interest in the technology field specifically software engineering as it was a field that I always wanted to learn about since 2011.  
          </p>
          <P class="center">
            Currently, I am a student at Thinkful pursuing my software engineering certificate and couldn't be more excited. Working in this field is very fulfilling.  If you are looking for someone to work with regarding any type of web development, please feel free to reach out.  Looking forward to it!
          </P>
